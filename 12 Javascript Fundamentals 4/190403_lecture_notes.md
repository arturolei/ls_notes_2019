## Review
### let, const, var, 
- `let` is block-scoped, cannot be re-declared but is mutable 
- `const` is block-scoped, IMMUTABLE 
- `var` can be redeclared. Mutable

### Obj literal
- basically a collection of key-value pairs, the values can be methods.
- dot notation vs bracket notation

### Array literals
- Review array methods

- "Use strict" enabled with classes
- WARNING: Hoisting does not occur with class declarations apparently
