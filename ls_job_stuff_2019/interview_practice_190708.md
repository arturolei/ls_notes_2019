# Interview Prep, 8 July 2019:
Thanks for joining, everyone! Video is still processing but I will drop here once it is done!

For this sprint, you have options depending on your familiarity and comfort level with interviewing; please complete the assignment that is the best match for you!
:small_blue_diamond: *If you are a very nervous interviewer or have limited experience:*
> - Complete the STAR & Common Interview Questions worksheet (linked below) with general responses that could apply to a range of technical work settings. Submit with your sprint retro next week.
> - BONUS: practice answering these questions aloud, and *extra bonus,* film yourself doing it! You don’t need to submit this, but it’s a great way to build your comfort level talking about your skills.

:small_blue_diamond: *If you are familiar with STAR/FEB but want to build your confidence relating your past experience to technical roles:*
> - Find a job description that you are fairly qualified for (you meet 50%-80% of the requirements), go through the mapping process we just did together, and write out responses in the STAR worksheet (linked below) that are specifically tailored to that role. Submit with your sprint retro, and be sure to include a link to the description in your STAR worksheet.
> - BONUS: practice answering these questions aloud, and *extra bonus,* film yourself doing it! You don’t need to submit this, but it’s a great way to build your comfort level talking about your skills.

*STAR WORKSHEET:* you will need to make a copy and save to your Google drive to edit
