# Lambda School, Day 4 Notes, 6 March 2019: Git For Web Development


## PM and Team Mtg:
- A lot you will learn on your own
- Prepare to struggle
- Swalllow your pride. Pride only hurts. It doesn't help (sometimes).


## Instructor Codepen/Project Link/Resources:
- [Terminal Command Cheat Sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/)

## General Observations/New Things Learned/Things to Review relating to Git for Web Development:
- BASH is Bourne Again Shell (on Mac, we get to use the terminal)
- Shell = way to interface with the actual OS (which would kind of be the kernel)
    - Nicer wy to run do things
- UNIX is OS, standard people can build to, servers don't typically have Windows on them. 
    - Websites will often run on things 
- Why do we use terminal commands?
    - Speed
    - Is GUI necessary when we could just use commands?

- `ls -l`, this will also list the permissions. 
- `ls -la`, this will also list hidden directories
- `Tab` allows for autocompletion

-  `cd ~` home directory 
-  `cd /` root directory DEFINITELY not home directory

- `rm` is for removing a file (DOES NOT GO TO RECYCLING BIN)

- `Git` is a protocol for distributed version control. GitHub is a cloud service for using git protocol version control.
    - GitHub is popular, well-tested and stable, and also there are pricing considerations
    - GitHub since acquisition has now free private repos. 

- git push origin (branchname) or you can use git push --set-upstream origin
- Code reviews and merging branches are part and parcel of real-life coding 
- **Important Skill**: LET GO OF YOUR PRIDE. 
    - Get used to getting criticism and review 
    - Just because someone has a problem with your code does not mean someone else has a problem with you personally
    - Code review
