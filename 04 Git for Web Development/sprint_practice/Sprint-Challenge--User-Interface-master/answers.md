# Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.


## 1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

*Semantic HTML is HTML that conveys meaning, for example `<footer>` or `<section>`; this constrasts with "presentational" HTML such as `<div>`*

## 2. Name two big differences between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

*`display:block` respects horizontal and vertical CSS properties, .e.g. `height` or `width`, and displays elements as a block, whereas `display:inline` respects only horizontal dimension. In other words, an element with `display:inline` such as `<span>` (by default) will be displayed inline, inside the current block, on the same line.*

## 3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
*`content`, `padding`, `border`, `margin`*

## 4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?
*`align-items` works on the cross axis*

## 5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
*git helps with distributed version control (keeping track of changes, especially important as a project's codebase and documentation grow in size and complexity) and allows for us to rollback changes or test changes in branches before pushing those changes onto a live/production branch. Git also lets us do work on local copies*
