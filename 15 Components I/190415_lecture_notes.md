## Misc Observations 
- Components are useful for not repeating yourself. 
- Compoments are all about reuse and creating parts, units you can reuse
- See Bootstrap and Bulma.
- Boostrap is insanely popular.
- Each event will return a different type of event object (a mouse event will have different properties than a clipboard event)
