# Lambda School, Day 2 Notes, 2/28/19


## PM and Team Mtg:
- More weeks of CSS ahead of us before we get to JS
- Keep practicing your JS because it comes back around. 
    - It's not necessarily a start from the beginning with JS; prepare to hit the ground running. 
- Advice: ake notes in .md
- Try Live Server (this lets you open an index.html as if it were a browser)
