## Misc Observations 
- DOM as an API for taping into and manipulating the HTML structure 
- DOM as language agnostic (not just JS but other languages should be able to use this)
- What is an `HTMLCollection`?
- Single Page App (no refreshing, things feel snappier, they feel more like application; it will look frightening)

:question: What if we wanted to select elements that had multiple classes and select using multiple classes?

-Node.appendChild() versus straight-up `.append([variableName])`
