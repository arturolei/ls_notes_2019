# Lambda School, Day 2 Notes, 2/25/19

## Overview of How Instructor Run Things:
- Cameron Pope, Director of Dev at bestcompany.com
- Learned on his own, impressed with the speed of Lambda
- Could do front-end within 6 months, to actually get back-end and JS really well (took much longer)
- Came of age/became coder after working in IKEA in the age when HTML/CSS knowledge was sufficient



## Overview of Lesson

## CodePen itself
- A way to simulate a website without linking the HTML/CSS or having to manage all those files
- Codepen has a nice CSS/HTML/JS section. It features a handy-dandy renderer

## Semantic/Presentational HTML
- Tips See emmet cheat sheet
- You should really only have 1 `<h1>`
- Comment about section should go before

## CSS Stuff (See Codepen)
- !important is VERY, VERY powerful/limited; LAST RESORT/NUCLEAR OPTION
