# Lambda School, Day 2 Notes, 2/28/19

## New Things:
- Context-box, border-box
- Reset vs normalize for CSS (look at Meyer Reset)
- zindex, absolute postion relative

## Instructor Codepen (my Fork):
https://codepen.io/arturolei/pen/YgwpVZ?editors=1100

## The Sprints are really the one that determine where you will be
- PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THE SPRINT
- SPRINT CHALLENGES ARE WHEN YOU GET EXPOSED
- 3 Hours to Finish the whole project
- "It gets real; this is where it get real"
- "Make sure you get the help you need"
- SPRINTS ARE BASICALLY WEEKLY EXAMS

## The Git Workflow:
1. Fork to your github
2. Add NLB510 as collaborator for that Fork
2. Hit Clone/Download to save the files on the desk. 
4. Create new branch arthur-lei
5. Do usual stuff push to new branch (via git push origin arthur-lei)
6. Make pull request to YOUR master branch from the new branch (INCLUDE NATE as reviewer)
7. Last commit, MVP commit
8. Mostly concerned with MVP

Look ahead at Git stuff


Do the pull request initially to get it out of the way.
Make commits (at least 4 as you work, not including)
